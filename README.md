# ♻️ AI-Powered Waste Reporting Platform

## 🛑 Problem Statement
Urban areas face significant challenges in waste management due to:
- 🚧 **Inefficient monitoring systems**
- 🕒 **Delayed response times**
- 🙅‍♂️ **Lack of citizen engagement**

The absence of real-time reporting mechanisms and proper incentivization has resulted in:
- 🗑️ **Accumulation of roadside waste**
- ⚠️ **Public health hazards**
- 🌍 **Environmental degradation**

---

## 💡 Solution Approach
Our project addresses these issues through an AI-powered waste management platform with the following key features:


1. **🖼️ Waste Detection with AI**:
   - Utilizes TensorFlow for image processing to accurately identify waste from citizen-submitted photos.
   - Tracks waste location for precise monitoring and reporting.

2. **⚙️ Automated Municipal Response**:
   - Generates real-time alerts for waste detection.
   - Assigns cleanup tasks to municipal workers and monitors their progress via a centralized dashboard.

3. **🤝 Citizen Engagement**:
   - Enables citizens to report waste by submitting photos.
   - Rewards contributors with redeemable points, fostering ongoing community involvement.

4. **📊 Data Analytics Integration**:
   - Leverages analytics for resource optimization and operational efficiency.
   - Tracks waste patterns and trends to support data-driven decision-making.

5. **🌱 Sustainability Focus**:
   - Follows the **4R principles**: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, and Recover.
   - Encourages sustainable waste management practices.
